title: The S3 Delegation Canvas Series
---

## Overview

Here's a set of simple and lightweight tools to bring more  clarity and transparency to your organization: the S3 Canvas Series.

As of now there's three different canvases: the [delegation canvas](#the-delegation-canvas), the [organization canvas](#the-organization-canvas) and the [team canvas](#the-team-canvas).

Filling in a canvas in a group typically takes between 30 and 45 minutes, and helps you to develop shared understanding around the organization itself, itâ€™s domains, and your circles or teams.

Each canvas consists of several sections that help you explore different aspects of your organization, domain or team. The sections are numbered to indicate the order of moving through a canvas. 


## The Delegation Canvas 

The **[S3 Delegation Canvas](s3-delegation-canvas.md)** can be used to describe or co-create the domain of a department, team, circle or role in an organization.

## The Team Canvas

The **[S3Team Canvas](s3-team-canvas.md)**, is a companion to the Delegation Canvas and helps a team or circle describe their "inwards" perspective, their development and the relationships of the team's members. The team canvas can be used to kickstart a new team, or to support an existing one.
