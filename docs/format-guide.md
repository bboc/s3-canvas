# Format Guide

Canvases are available in several different formats to allow for many different workflows, paper-based and digital, online and offline, individual and collaborative. 

Go to the [downloads page](downloads.md) for the actual downloads.


## Traditional Canvas Format 

The traditional canvas format is a boxed layout to be printed (usually in A3 or larger) or to be used in visual planning tools (e.g. [cnvrg](cnvrg.com)).

The traditional canvas format is availale in the following versions:

* a pdf file with the plain canvas to print as A3 or larger for use in workshops and meetings
* a pdf file with instructions which can be used as a facilitation guide (e.g. together with the plain canvas, or when using flipcharts or whiteboards for the actual canvas)
* a png file (140dpi) with the plain canvas to to be used as a template with visual planning tools
* a png file (140dpi) with instructions (slighly faded) for use in visual planning tools


## Multipage Documents


This format allows for many file-based and online-workflows, as well as for printing on a standard A4 printer.

These canvases are [available in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxQOKigYtzogVUlnZm1MOFF3VlU?usp=sharing) as Google Docs. 

There's two versions for each canvas:

### Online Version

This Google Document can be used online, or downloaded in various formats (e.g. docx). Even if your logbook is not based on Google Docs, you can integrate it seamlessy into many apps such as Trello, Evernote for Business, or Confluence.

To use this template, simply make a copy and fill it in. Delete the instructional texts in each section as you go.

Make sure to use hyperlinks to reference other pages, documents, cards or notes where valuable. 

### Print Version  

This version contains just the headlines for each section (and a few text fields) and is formatted to A4, so you can use any old printer you have sitting around. It's great for the [delegation game](/s3-delegation-canvas.md#the-delegation-game), creating organization canvases in group workshops, or for solo work.
