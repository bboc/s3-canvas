# Delegation Canvas Example: <br/>Architecture Circle

[back to the delegation canvas guide](../s3-delegation-canvas.md)


## 1. Primary Driver / Purpose

_"As our product portfolio grows, our apps mature, and the number of developers increases, we need alignment on architecture and guidance on software craftsmanship in order to remain productive."_


## 2. Key Responsibilities

- awareness of status quo of and creation of a vision for architecture and craftsmanship
- lead mid- and long-term initiatives to improve architecture and craftsmanship
- balance short-term and long-term productivity 


## 3. Dependencies

- development teams (will have to work with the output of this circle, and will provide feedback on quality of architecture decision and coaching)
- product owners (architecture needs to be aligned to product strategy and current customer needs)
- strategy team (strategy is a driver for architectural decisions and vision)


## 4. External Constraints

- architectural changes must not stall product releases, so product owners can veto them
- architecture decisions can be vetoed by development teams
- craftsmanship needs to be aligned with development teams


## 5. Key Challenges

- different tech stacks and codebases of varied quality
- knowledge silos in some teams
- some teams have 50% new hires


## 6. Key Deliverables

- a mid- and long-term strategy for evolving software architecture
- backlog for impediments relating to architectural and craftsmanship
- high-level coding guidelines that enable software craftmanship (aligned with all development team)
- architecture workshops with development teams
- at least one hands-on coaching session with each team member per quarter


## 7. Competencies, qualities and skills

At least half of the circle's members must have been with the company for at least 3 years.

If possible, members of the Architecture Circle should have the following expertise:

- current role: software developer 
- several years of experience developing software on a code base that is at least 5 years old
- understanding of the relevant current architecture patterns
- nice to have: experience in workshop design and facilitation


## 8. Key Resources

- architecture team can veto new features for a product when quality of codebase is threatened
- members of architecture team reduce their development capacity to a minimum of 50%


## 9. Delegator Responsibilities

Since the Architecture Circle has been formed on the initiative of the development teams, it's their responsibility to support the circle as good as they can, e.g. by

- implementing the circle's the decisions in the absence of objections
- raising any possible objections against the circle's decisions
- bringing to the circles attention any relevant observations about the code base


## 10. Key Metrics 

- simple monthly anonymous survey on developer satisfaction with architecture (current and outlook)  and current health of the code bases
- number of coaching sessions per month and developer
- number of architectural issues in the backlog with severity "high" or "critical"


## 11. Monitoring and Evaluation

A team review every quarter:

-   3-5 software developers from different teams
-   product owners
-   CTO
