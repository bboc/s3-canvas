[back to the delegation canvas guide](../s3-delegation-canvas.md)

## 1. Primary Driver / Mission

_"As our product portfolio grows, our apps mature, and the number of developers increases, we need alignment on architecture and guidance on software craftsmanship in order to remain productive."_

## 2. Key Responsibilities

- awareness of status quo of and creation of a vision for architecture and craftsmanship
- lead mid- and long-term initiatives to improve architecture and craftsmanship
- balance short-term and long-term productivity 

## 3. Key Challenges

- different tech stacks and codebases of varied quality
- knowledge silos in some teams
- some teams have 50% new hires


## 4. Key Constraints

- architectural changes must not stall product releases, so product owners can veto them
- architecture decisions can be vetoed by development teams
- craftsmanship needs to be aligned with development teams

## 5. Key Deliverables

- aligned coding guidelines
- architectural vision
- backlog for impediments relating to architectural and craftsmanship
- architecture workshops with development teams
- at least one hands-on coaching session with each team member per quarter

## 6. Key Metrics

- simple monthly anonymous survey on developer satisfaction with architecture (current and outlook) 
- number of coaching sessions per month and developer
- number of architectural issues in the backlog with severity "high" or "critical"

## 7. Key Resources

- architecture team can veto new features for a product when quality of codebase is threatened
- members of architecture team reduce their development capacity to 50%

## 8. Evaluation

- team review every quarter, with a selection of:
    + developers
    + product owners
    + CTO

## 9. Consumers

- development teams

## 10. Providers

- strategy team (strategy is a driver for architectural decisions and vision)
- product owners (architecture needs to be aligned to product)
- development teams (feedback on quality of architecture decision and coaching)
