S3 Delegation Canvas
rev. 2017-05-15

The S3 Delegation Canvas is a tool for negotiating and clarifying the delegation of a domain to a team or role. Sections are numbered to indicate the suggested order of moving through the canvas.


1. Primary Driver / Mission

Justify the domain: Why does the team/role exist, what is the need it responds to?

2. Key Responsibilities

Clarify domain further by listing top three responsibilities (common goals or objectives), preferably with a measurable outcome for each one.

3. Key Challenges

List at least three important challenges to the success of the team/role: e.g. risk, uncertainty, lack of skills or resources.

4. Key Constraints

List important constraints to the autonomy and influence of the team/role (e.g. shared resources, time, budget, audits, expected reports).

5. Key Deliverables

What does the team/role provide to meet the key responsibilities and key challenges? What do other parties expect from the team/role? Describe the top three deliverables (products, services, experiences or transformations). 

6. Key Metrics

How can you measure success in accounting for the domain and addressing key responsibilities? Prefer simple, continuous and actionable metrics.

7. Key Resources
List  essential resources, assets or privileges the team/role can make use of in accounting for its domain.

8. Evaluation
Describe schedule for review of the delegation, evaluation criteria in addition  the metrics (above), and any other relevant aspects of the evaluation.

9. Consumers

Describe customers (those who consume the team's output) and other essential stakeholders. 

10. Providers

List providers of products or services essential to the work of the team/role, and describe reasonable expectations about the delivery.


The Delegation Game: a simple and fun activity to define and delegate a new domain, or to develop shared understanding and reveal misconceptions about an existing domain. Gather those delegating the domain (e.g. a manager) and those the domain is delegated to (e.g. somebody in a role or position, or the members of a team). Allow for 15 minutes for each participant to fill in their canvas individually, and then go through each section together, comparing notes and agreeing on the details of the domain.
